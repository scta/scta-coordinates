Page order Notes

0059 in Transkribus Order is actually 3r and out of order
92v and 93r are missing in Transkribus document/export

printed Text 200r actually says 100, but this is a mistake and is really 200

0459 and 0460 are repeats of (0457 / 222v ) and (0458 / 223r) respectively in transcrkribus document/export

225v (out of order) should come between 0464 and 0465 found in position 0470
